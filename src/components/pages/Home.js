                     My name is Luna and I am a German Sheperd mix.  I was born in the Bakersfield/Fresno area but then my sister and I were
                     brought up to the Bay Area and stayed at the Family Dog Rescue Shelter.  We were there a couple of weeks before we 
                     were let out to meet people.

                    Within the first week of being able to see people, a nice family of three young people came in and picked myself 
                    and my sister as pets they thought they might want.  We were still tired from our traveling so we did not do 
                    much, but the family liked how mellow we were.  They wanted to take my sister and I together but the shelter would
                    not let them take both of us.

                    So, off I went, with my new family.  Now I am almost one year old and I am having a great time.  I love being outside,
                    running around, playing fetch, biting whatever I can get my teeth on and getting my belly rubbed.
